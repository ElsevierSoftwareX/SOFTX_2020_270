We present ResiPy, a Python object-oriented software to compute the annual
production resilience indicator. This indicator can be applied to different anthropic and
natural systems, e.g., agricultural production, natural vegetation and water resources,
to quantify their stabilities and the risk of adverse events. We propose an illustrative
application of ResiPy to agricultural production in Europe, expressed in economic
terms. After estimating the single-country or single-crop resilience, we evaluate the
overall resilience of diversified production systems, composed of different crops and
different cultivation areas. ResiPy also includes a powerful graphical tool to visually
estimate the impact of diversity on complex production systems. The robustness of the
indicator and the simplicity of the code ensure its effective applicability in many fields
and with different datasets
